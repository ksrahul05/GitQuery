# GitQuery – RAG Powered GitHub Repository Assistant 🚀

GitQuery is an intelligent assistant that helps developers, open-source contributors, and project managers navigate, understand, and explore large GitHub repositories without manual setup or code reading. Using **LangChain**, **LLMs**, and **embedding-based similarity search**, GitQuery provides instant summaries, architecture explanations, and query-driven insights.

## 📂 Features

- 🔍 **Repository Summarization:** Automatically summarizes files and code structure using large language models.  
- ⚙️ **Embedding-based Search:** Enables similarity search to find relevant documentation or code snippets based on user queries.  
- 👥 **Enhanced Onboarding:** Assists new developers with explanations and navigation in large or undocumented repositories.  
- 📈 **Productivity Booster:** Reduces time spent on code exploration, debugging, and reviewing.
